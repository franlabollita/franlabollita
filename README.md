### About Me ###
I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·, but grew up in Bermuda ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡² and Miami, USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸. At around the age of 12, my family made the decision to return to Buenos Aires, where I've stayed since. In my free time, I enjoy engaging in football, honing my chess skills, appreciating movies, and delving into books.
